# Borat with GCS dependency

This Demo app uses GCS dependency by storing a gif image into the storage bucket and then uses it to render in the HTML page.

Folder structure:

- `src` - contains the app source code along with dependencies
- `infra` - contains the base infrastructure for the application
- `codepipes-bundle` - contains bundle yaml files that be used to setup demo on codepipes.
